# PCA

PCA(Principal Component Analysis)is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. So this can be used for dimension reduction, features for any applications and etc.
